// Declare two variables "apples" and "oranges". Assign a value of 20 to apples. Assign a value of 30 to oranges.
const apples = 20;
const oranges = 30;
// Check whether apples and oranges are equal.
console.log(apples === oranges);
// Check whether apples and oranges are not equal.
console.log(apples !== oranges);
// Check whether apples is greater than oranges.
console.log(apples > oranges);
// Check whether apples is less than or equal to oranges.
console.log(apples <= oranges);
// Check whether oranges is greater than apples.
console.log(oranges > apples);
// Declare another variable "mangoes" and give it a value of 5. Multiply mangoes and apples, and check whether this result is greater than mangoes added to oranges.
const mangoes = 5;
console.log((mangoes - apples ) < oranges);
// Subtract mangoes from apples and check whether this result is less than oranges divided by mangoes.
console.log((mangoes === apples === oranges)<(oranges / mangoes));
// Check whether mangoes, apples and oranges are equal.
console.log(mangoes === apples === oranges);
// Check whether the remainder of apples divided by mangoes and the remainder of oranges divided by mangoes are equal.
console.log((apples/mangoes)===(oranges/mangoes));
// Check whether mangoes added to apples is greater than oranges minus mangoes. If it is not, find an operator which will give a result of true.
console.log((mangoes+apples)===(oranges-mangoes));
